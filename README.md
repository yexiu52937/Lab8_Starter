# Lab 8 - Starter

## 1) In your own words: Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?
I would choose 2 which is manually run them locally before pushing code. Check and fix the bugs before pushing would make the following steps work better and the whole development process more effective, otherwise the problems will be detected later one need to edit more to fix it.

## 2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
No
